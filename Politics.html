      <h2>Irish Politics in Transition: Coalition Talks Underway</h2>
      <p>The Irish political landscape is in flux following the general election on November 29, 2024. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael secured a combined 86 seats, just shy of the 88 needed for a majority, prompting coalition talks with independent lawmakers. Sinn Féin, with 39 seats, has also explored options for a left-wing minority government, though its chances remain slim.

A historic moment came with Verona Murphy’s election as the first female Ceann Comhairle, a sign of evolving political dynamics. Meanwhile, the Green Party suffered significant losses, sparking concerns about the future of Ireland’s climate commitments.

As negotiations continue, the next government's ability to address pressing issues, including environmental policy and public trust, remains critical for Ireland's political and social future..</p>
