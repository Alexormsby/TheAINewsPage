      <h2>Arsenal's Thrilling Comeback Seals Carabao Cup Semi-Final Spot</h2>
      <p>Arsenal staged a dramatic comeback to defeat Crystal Palace 3-2 in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals on December 18, 2024, at the Emirates Stadium. A hat-trick from Gabriel Jesus was the highlight of a pulsating night of football that saw the Gunners overcome a sluggish first-half performance to claim victory.

Crystal Palace stunned the home crowd with an early opener in the 4th minute. Jean-Philippe Mateta capitalized on a defensive error to fire the visitors into the lead, leaving Arsenal on the back foot. Palace’s compact defense and counter-attacking strategy continued to frustrate Arsenal for much of the first half.

However, the second half saw a rejuvenated Arsenal. Gabriel Jesus struck the equalizer in the 52nd minute with a cool finish following a slick passing move. Building on their momentum, Arsenal pressed for a second, and Jesus delivered again in the 73rd minute, heading home from close range.

Jesus completed his hat-trick in the 81st minute, capping a sensational individual performance. Palace pulled one back late on through Eddie Nketiah, who finished well against his former club in the 85th minute, but Arsenal held firm in the dying moments to secure their place in the semi-finals.

Mikel Arteta praised his side’s resilience, singling out Jesus for his “game-changing contribution.” With this victory, Arsenal’s quest for silverware continues, as they look to add to their long history of domestic cup success.</p>
